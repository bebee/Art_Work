# Art_Work
<b>By : Franco Baudino</b>

Instead of Neural Network its "Art_Work". Going to be using this repo to host a neural network that is going to be used to handle images, and hopefully create some artwork

Going to start off by using the Mona Lisa to train the network, and then use different configurations of inputs to see various outputs
