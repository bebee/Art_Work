/* Current Status
    This network is going to be used to create art by being trained on specific peices of art
  
*/


/*  Current Problems
   Clean code File Manager classs and move the saveweights() and loadWeights() methods to the network class
   Make the sizeof the network dependent on some setting rather than hardcoding the size and length into the array in the nettwork class
   
   
   Look into confidence intervals to prove that the network is learning
   Make the filemanager arraylist two dimensional to hold multiple neuron's traing data; currently it only pairs one input value with another output value
   Have a way of graphing the samples to see what function the net is learning
